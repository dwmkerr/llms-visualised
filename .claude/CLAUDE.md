# LLMs Visualised

## Writing Style

- **Direct, not performative.** Don't end sections with grand rhetorical flourishes ("And machines can work with geometry." / "Similarity becomes distance."). State things plainly.
- **Questions over invitations.** Prefer "Where do we go from here?" over "Let's see how." — the first is direct, the second is salesy.
- **No unnecessary numbers.** When describing scored words on a dimension, don't include the literal score in parentheses (e.g. "Dog scores highest" not "Dog scores highest (9)"). The visualization makes it obvious.
